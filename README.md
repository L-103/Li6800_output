# Li6800 project
This project has been created of some work done at UmeÃ¥ Plant Science Center. Let me know if you have some questions on how to implement it in your lab.

**Here are the guidelines to:**
- control your LI6800 from the confort of your desk while it's running in the greenhouse
- easily get access to the data that you want from the machine

## Get control over your LI6800
1. Connect the ethernet cable between the Li6800 dedicated computer (LIcomputer) and the console
2. Connect the LIcomputer to internet
   - SSID: "eduroam"
   - ID: your email address
   - Password: your password
Remember to log out and remove credentials (right-click "forget") when you are done. If not, the next user will have your credentials directly input.
3. Create an account and download the client for [HelpWire](https://www.helpwire.app/) (free alternative to TeamViewer) on the LIcomputer. You should then have a file in the download folder in the form of "HelpWire + yourname"
4. Connect to your HelpWire account on your desk computer (through your internet browser).
5. Grant access of your LIcomputer to your desk computer.
**6. From now on, you should be able to control the LIcomputer through your desk computer.**
7. On the LIcomputer, start the RealVNC software.
8. Choose the connection with your LI6800. If for some reason the connection doesn't establish, check your IP parameters. The IP address of your computer should be in the range of the LICOR device. For example, if LICOR IP address is 169.254.148.18, the computer IP address should be 169.254.148.20 for instance. To change that on your computer, go to Ethernet settings > Change adapter options > Ethernet > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > change the IP address.
**9. From now on, you should have direct control over your LI6800 through your desk computer.**

**Summary**
Desk computer -- _HelpWire_ -- LIcomputer -- _RealVNC_ -- LI6800

Please note that you can have direct access to your LICOR files from the LIcomputer from now on. Just go to "Your PC" and "Z://logs". If asked for credentials

## Use the custom made R project
I have made this R project in case you want to:
- easily check some parameters recorded during the experiment
- easily extract only some parameters in case you don't want to handle the 292 column excel file
- automatically draw the flash curves corresponding to your experiment

To use it, nothing simpler:
1. Start Rstudio
2. The LI6800_output project should already loaded. If not: File > Open Project > Document > Li6800_output > Li6800_output_2.
3. Click on Run Document
  - The script should start and quickly ask you to select your file of interest. By default, the directory you will be directed to is the LI6800 log folder itself. Select the raw file (**not the excel!**).
  - You will have an html page rendered from which you have access to 2 pages: "Main Graph" and "Fluorometer_data". 

### Main graph page explanation

- You can choose the value displayed on both axis of the graph. You can also play around with minimum and maximum values displayed. This can be useful in case you have some outliers completely messing up your graph.
- The LI-6800 Summary of symbols button will bring you to the LICOR webpage explaining all the symbols you will find in the dropdown menus.
- Below that button is my email address in case you want to discuss about problems, questions or suggestions about all of this.
- The main graph displays what you want on each axis.
- The first download button allows you to download only the data displayed on the graph.
- Export Data: a list of the most useful parameters is available in the dropdown menu. Add as many as you want to get a file you can then open in excel with only those parameters. If you wish to get more parameters, tick the "show all parameters in the options" square and you will have all the parameters available.

### Fluorometer_data page explanation
- If no flashes were made during that experiment, nothing will be displayed on this second page.
- Tick which flash you want (the order follows your logs order=
- Download only flash data by clicking on the button.
