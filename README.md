# Li6800_output_2
This project has been created of some work done at Ume√• Plant Science Center. Let me know if you have some questions on how to implement it in your lab.

**Here are the guidelines to:**
- control your LI6800 from the confort of your desk while it's running in the greenhouse
- easily get access to the data that you want from the machine

## Get control over your LI6800
1. Connect the LI6800 dedicated computer to internet
   - SSID: "eduroam"
   - ID: your email address
   - Password: your password
2. Create an account and download the client for [HelpWire](https://www.helpwire.app/) (free alternative to TeamViewer)
